My logic for picking a card is based on two principles:
-1 the higher the stake card is, the more valuable it is so the bid should be higher.
-2 there is a better chance of winning if the opponent plays a different card to you. (since no possibility of drawing)

So based on 1. the chosen card should be near to the value of the stake card, preferably higher. (so the logic tries to pick the same value, +1 or +2)
And based on 2. a choice of card that the opponent has already played is preferred.
A random card is chosen if all else fails.
